### _Crowdsourced Logistics Network for Disasters_

### Introduction

When a disaster strikes, the main bottleneck for recovery is resources, or the lack
thereof. However this is not a problem that can be solved by simply adding more money and
resources, the real problem is inefficient distribution. This is a problem that can even affect
centralized organizations like NGOs and is a major prohibitor of recovery for decentralized
systems.

Each household possesses resources, yet faces needs. If these providers and
consumers are made aware of each other, they can help each other with their deficits.

### Functionalities

The system’s main functionality is to facilitate interaction between providers and
consumers, considering factors such as location and type of resource.The system acts as the
mediator between the producers and consumers. All the users will be able to post their
surpluses and requirements to a common database and be matched with potential
providers/consumers that can fulfill their needs

As well as this, some extra functionalities can also be added such as integration with
NGOs and government agencies that are also helping with recovery or location services,
emergency alerts and resource tracking

However useful the platform may be, there is always a chance for users to misuse it.
There will also be functionalities to reduce the spread of these people and to promote a sense
of harmony among the users

### Implementation

Technically, the app will have a relational database that contains all the resources and
users will be able to interact with this database through a frontend mobile application. By
including factors such as location, the system can show only feasible options to users

The UI for showing the viable consumers can be implemented in multiple ways, based
on different social media platforms that people will be comfortable with such as Snapchat’s Heat
Map or a more formal tabular representation

In order to decrease toxicity and misuse, a ‘like’ system will be implemented to promote
positive interactions along with a rating and reporting system to flag misuse

### Shortcomings

While the app can take steps to prevent misuse, there is no guarantee that misuse will
not happen, but we hope that we can trust the users to use the system well, particularly in times
of disaster.
